### Steps to reproduce

- [ ] Tell us what broke. The more detailed the better.
- [ ] Include the `feathers-gen-specs.json` file from your app.
- [ ] Include the `src/services/[serviceName]/[serviceName].schema.?s` files if the issue involves the fields in one or more services.

These last 2 items usually allow us to regen enough of your app to recreate the issue.
We may otherwise ask you to provide a minimal GitHub repo or gist isolating the issue.
